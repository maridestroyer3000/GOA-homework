    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><b>Miss Me Jeans is a fashion brand founded in 2001 in Los Angeles, known for its edgy, Western-inspired denim featuring heavily embellished back pockets with rhinestones, studs, and intricate stitching.
    Created to empower young women with bold, expressive fashion, the brand gained popularity in the 2000s for its bootcut, skinny, and flare jeans that stood out for their flashy designs. Expanding beyond denim, Miss Me introduced jackets, dresses, and tops, all staying true to its glam-rock aesthetic. 
    Widely sold in major department stores like Macy’s and Buckle, the brand became especially popular among teens, country music fans, and performance communities like cheer and dance. 
    Though its peak was in the late 2000s, Miss Me has retained a loyal following and seen renewed interest with Gen Z’s revival of Y2K fashion.Miss Me Jeans was launched by the fashion house Kizan International, 
    originally to fill a gap in the market for premium denim that was both fashionable and affordable. The brand quickly became known for its iconic, heavily decorated back pockets, often featuring intricate embroidery, sequins, rhinestones, crosses, wings, fleur-de-lis designs,
    and other bold motifs. Aimed at confident, style-forward women who weren’t afraid to stand out, Miss Me became a staple in country and Southern fashion scenes, worn at rodeos, concerts, and even on stage by performers. Their jeans offered a figure-flattering fit, durable denim, and were especially popular among teenage girls and young women in the 2000s and early 2010s.
    The brand expanded into additional collections, including Miss Me Girls for younger customers and lines of tops, skirts, shorts, jackets, and dresses that retained the same glam-meets-Western flair. While trends shifted away from the ultra-decorative denim look by the mid-2010s, Miss Me maintained a strong niche fanbase. In recent years, interest in early 2000s fashion has \
    resurged, and Miss Me jeans have been rediscovered by younger generations looking for unique, vintage-inspired statement pieces. Often associated with individuality, music culture, and expressive fashion, Miss Me continues to operate with a focus on bold detail, feminine energy, and American Western influence.</b></p>
