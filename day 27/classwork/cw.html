        <p style="background-color: black; color:aliceblue"><b>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes
         They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is equatorial, 
         with a small portion of its population extending slightly north of the equator (within a quarter degree of latitude). 
         Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. 
         Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. 
         A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.</b></p>
