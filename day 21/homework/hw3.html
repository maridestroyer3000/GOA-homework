    <p style="background-color: black; color:darkgoldenrod">Adventure Time[c] is an American fantasy animated television series created by 
    Pendleton Ward and co-produced by Frederator Studios for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn (Jeremy Shada) 
    and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)â€”a dog with the power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the
    post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia Olson),
    BMO (Niki Yang), and others.</p>
    <h4><p style="background-color: aqua; color:darkblue">The series is based on a 2007 short film that aired on Nicktoons. After the short became
    a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's executives passed on its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Fred 
    Seibert and Ward, which was previewed on March 11, 2010. The same year, the series premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, and it ended its 
    eight-year run on September 3, 2018. The series was followed by the Adventure Time: Distant Lands specials and the Adventure Time: Fionna and 
    Cake spin-off, which were released on Max.</p></h4>
    <h3><p style="background-color: deeppink; color:indigo">The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy
    role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes were 
    decided by storyboard artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes 
    were worked on concurrently.</p></h3>
    <h2><p style="background-color: darkred; color:white">The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed 
    guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill 
    half-hour program slots. Adventure Time was a ratings success for Cartoon Network, with some of its episodes attracting over three million 
    viewers, and has developed a following among teenagers and adults alongside the show's target audience of children.</p></h2>
    <h1><p style="background-color: lightpink; color:darkmagenta">Adventure Time has received universal acclaim from critics, with much praise for 
    its originality and worldbuilding. The show won eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, two British Academy Children's
    Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television 
    Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a Sundance Film Festival Award, among others. </p></h1>
