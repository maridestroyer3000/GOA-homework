    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><b>Lay’s is one of the world’s most popular potato chip brands, owned by PepsiCo and originally founded in 1932 by Herman Lay in the United States. 
    Known for its thin, crispy texture and wide range of flavors, Lay’s is sold in over 200 countries and adapts its offerings to local tastes, with unique varieties like Magic Masala in India or Seaweed in parts of Asia. 
    While classic flavors like Original, Barbecue, and Sour Cream & Onion remain favorites, the brand constantly innovates with limited-edition releases and flavor contests like “Do Us a Flavor.” 
    Lay’s is recognized not only for its consistent quality and flavor but also for creative marketing and global appeal.</b></p>
